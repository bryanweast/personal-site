description: "After some tinkering with GatsbyJS I was pretty excited about moving my blog over from Jekyll - great performance, SEO and accesibility out of the box were one reason, and the fact I know far more React/JS than Ruby was another.  This post covers my experiences, as well as a few shortcuts that helped make the transition relatively painless."
