If you decide to use GatsbyJS for your blog I would highly recommend starting with a simple starter and building up.  [Gatsby blog starter] is simple enough that you can browse the code and start making changes immediately.  One feature that really adds some personality to your site is featured images for your posts - both on the post list, and on the post itself.  The rest of this article walks through the steps needed to go from the starter to the starter with images.
